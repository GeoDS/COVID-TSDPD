# COVID-TSDPD
Seeding efficient large-scale public health interventions in diverse spatial-social networks

# Significance Statement
Implementation of public health interventions at the regional level to achieve a national goal should consider spillovers through spatial-social networks, regional heterogeneity, and the feedback effects on health outcomes and network structures. We build a **threshold spatial dynamic panel data (TSDPD)** model with these features to identify intervention effect channels, compare the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of different seeding strategies, demonstrate the spatial distributions of benefits and costs, and inform the optimal termination of campaign efforts. This analytical framework can be applied to address other challenges such as climate change adaptation, antimicrobial resistance, and biodiversity loss where spillover effects are critical. Analysis based on COVID-19 suggests that leveraging social network influence leads to the most cost-effective intervention.
